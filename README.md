🌤️ Weather Forecast Dashboard (Power BI)

This project is a Power BI Dashboard that provides real-time and forecasted weather conditions, air quality data, and other environmental insights. The dashboard helps visualize weather patterns, pollution levels, and forecasts in an interactive and user-friendly format.

🚀 Features

Current Weather Data

Location-based temperature (°C)

Weather conditions (e.g., Mist, Sunny, Cloudy)

Live updates via data refresh

Weather Forecast

7-day temperature forecast with line chart visualization

Sunrise & Sunset timings

Environmental Data

Humidity, Wind Speed, Pressure, Visibility, UV Index, and Precipitation

Chance of rain probability with percentage breakdown

Air Quality Index (AQI)

AQI value with health advisory (Good, Moderate, Poor, etc.)

Pollutant breakdown: PM10, PM2.5, O3, NO2, SO2, CO

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Power BI Desktop / Power BI Service

Data Sources:

Weather API (e.g., OpenWeather
)

AQI API (e.g., IQAir
)

Data Transformation: Power Query (ETL process)

Data Visualization: Power BI charts, cards, slicers, and custom visuals
